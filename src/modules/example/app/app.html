            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
            I first became interested in coding after a frustrating experience trying to find an eye doctor. Many of the websites 
            I visited offered little transparency around accepted insurance plans or even the cost of a basic checkup. With no prior 
            programming experience, I set out to see if I could create a better solution and began building simple prototype websites.
            What started as a small personal project quickly evolved into a genuine passion for software development and, ultimately, 
            a career change. Today, I’m driven by the same motivation: to design applications that simplify everyday experiences, improve
            accessibility, and make meaningful, tangible impacts on people’s lives
            </p>
            <h3>About Me</h3>
             <p>
                Outside of work I am a passionate skier, surfer and mountain biker and you can typically find me somewhere in the
                White Mountains, Green Mountains or Seacoast of New Hampshire
            </p>
