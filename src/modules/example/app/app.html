            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                I began to learn to code after a challenging experiencing finding an eye doctor. The websites I encountered contained 
                little information on what insurance the doctors took or how much a basic checkup might cost. Although I had no coding
                experiece, I wanted to see if I could improve the process and built some sample websites. This ignited a love for coding
                and an eventual career change. My passion for building applications and making some small improvement peoples day to day 
                lives has not waned and Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and building.
            </p>
            <h3>About Me</h3>
             <p>

                White Mountains, Green Mountains or Seacoast of New Hampshire
