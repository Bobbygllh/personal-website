        <h1>Website Build with LWC OSS and Github Pages</h1>

        <h2>Why LWC OSS</h2>
        <p>
            While investigating what framework I could build this site in, I came across Lightning Web Components Open Source. I had come
            across them a bit while reading release articles/updates from Salesforce but never had a use case. As I looked into React and
            other frameworks, I came back to LWC OSS as I thought it was a good opportunity to build something in a framework I was comfortable
            in and demonstrate my skillset with LWCs. While there are some expected and unexpected limitations, overall it was a good experience,
            though I can't imagine there will be a use case I encounter where LWC OSS is the best option.
        </p>
        <h3>Positives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As I mentioned above, LWC OSS is LWC, so it a framework I was comfortable with and could problem solve quickly with</li>
            <li>Not battling the Lightning styling when trying to tweak styling was a nice change of pace</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Negatives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lightning components (like lightning-input) and SLDS classes are not available</li>
            <li>The challenges with loading and working with 3rd party libararies still exists</li>
            <li>There is not a significant community using LWC OSS and the lack of support makes things challenging. </li>
            <li>Figuring out the changes necessary to get the site compatible with Github Pages was painful</li>
            <li>Everything needs to be built custom. There is likely some path towards getting a styling library like bootstrap but
                the lack of community resources on how exactly that would function made it a bit daunting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            So a few more items in the negative category than the positive category but I am happy with the result.
